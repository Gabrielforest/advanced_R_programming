# John Hopkins University course

At this course advanced topics in R programming were discussed for developing powerful, robust, and reusable data science tools. Topics covered include functional programming in R, robust error handling, object oriented programming, profiling and benchmarking, debugging, and proper design of functions. This course turn me able to identify and abstract common data analysis tasks and to encapsulate them in user-facing functions. Because every data science environment encounters unique data challenges, there is always a need to develop custom software specifically. Defining new data types in R developing a functionality specific to those data types to enable cleaner execution of data science tasks and stronger reusability within a team.
